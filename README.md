# Contribution Rule (To Be Strictly Followed)
1. Add your name in this read me at [**Contributors**](#contributors) section first and wait for merge
2. Issue should be added first adding code
3. Don't commit changes to _master_ branch, rather check _How to Work as a Contributor_ [here](#how-to-work-as-a-contributor)
4. Add subdirectories if same code has different implementations with same dependencies and language
5. README.md file must exists in every directory (not subdirectories if exists) like [this](https://github.com/tbhaxor/school_college_projects/blob/master/STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_IN_PHP_MYSQL/README.md)

# How to Work as a Contributor
1. Create a branch at local repository
> git checkout -b <enter_branch_name>

2. Commit all the changes to current branches
3. Test and run
4. Finally, when everything is done push the current branch to _origin_
> git push origin <enter_branch_name>

5. Compare and create new pull request
