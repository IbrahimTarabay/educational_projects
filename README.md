# Contribution Rule (To Be Strictly Followed)
1. Don't commit changes to _master_ branch, rather check _How to Work as a Contributor_ [here](#how-to-work-as-a-contributor)
2. Add subdirectories if same code has different implementations with same dependencies and language
3. README.md file must exists in every directory (not subdirectories if exists) like [this](https://github.com/tbhaxor/educational_projects/blob/master/STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_IN_PHP_MYSQL/README.md)
4. Projects without commenting and readme will not be merged
5. Projects should be added in correct path

# Downloading A Particular Projects
1. Locate the project in repo
```
suppose i want to download <b>Finance Program</b>
```
# Readme Rule (only for Contributors)
A readme should contain the following
+ Project Description
+ How to setup, with text (commands) and screen shots
for example check [this](https://github.com/tbhaxor/educational_projects/blob/master/STUDENT_MANAGEMENT_IN_PHP_MYSQL/README.md) readme

# How to Work as a Contributor
1. Create a branch at local repository
```
 git checkout -b <enter_branch_name>
```
2. Commit all the changes to current branches
3. Test and run
4. Finally, when everything is done push the current branch to _origin_
```
git push origin <enter_branch_name>
```
5. Compare and create new pull request
